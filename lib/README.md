Project title: R Notebook on Lyrics Analysis

This project is conducted by Xiyi Yan

Project summary: In this project, I did an analysis on whether different song genres have specific features based on the lyrics. I explore the most frequently used words both in general and in each genre of songs. I also did sentiment analysis on the lyrics, including getting the average sentiment scores by genres and drawing heatmap of 10 sentiments based on the lexicon for each genre.
