### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Comparison of Song Lyrics by Genre
+ This project is conducted by Xiyi Yan

+ Project summary: In this project, I conducted a research to investigate if different genres of songs display specific features based on the lyrics. First I got the frequency of words both in general and for each genre. Secondly, I did sentimental analysis on the lyrics by genres, including getting the average sentiment scores and creating heatmap based on sentiment lexicon. In my conclusion, I found that in general, Metal and Jazz songs display more obvious patterns than others. Metal songs are more negative and Jazz songs are more positive than others.
